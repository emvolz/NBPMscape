# Version 0.2.0 

## Age structure 

- Polymod mixing matrix
    * distinct mixing for work and home 
- Scale rates of :severe infection with age 

## More realistic importation dynamics 

- Short-duration contacts at port-of-entry (similar to commuter dynamics)
- Home region should be drawn prop-to population density
    * simulate 1-way migration from port-of-entry to home region

## Long distance migration 

- Scalable migration matrix for occasional long-distance travel 



# Version 0.3.0 

## Sample parameters 

- Defined ranges for covid-like and pandemic-flu-like 
- Pipeline for experiments: sampling parameters and simulating forests 




# Version 0.4.0 

## Phylogenetic tree simulation 

- Include 'nodes' in Infection for tracking MRCAs 
- Compute chronological and genetic distances between sample units 
- Tree figures using Phylo.jl 

## Maps 

- Density of imports, infections, clusters etc.
